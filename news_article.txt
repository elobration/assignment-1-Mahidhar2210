The aggressive and hostile situation created by Nazis durint 1930's in germany were the root cause of world war 2. These also include the bad behavious against the jews. The rediculous ideology put forwarded by them has targeted a specific community. Jewish shops were offended and were forecefully shut down. The annoyed jews were sent to concentration camps stating that they are against their government. This foolish and illogical behaviour has created cheos in a well civilized country. On the other hand germans used to adore the Nazis for their National Socialistic Principles. Germans in large numbers attended the meetings of their beloved leader and are ready to do what is demands. Nazis are benevolent towards the native germans. They created good job opportunites and developed excellent infrastructure like the world's first highways called autobauns. They always are proud of their german culture and are always celebratory and enthusiastice. Nazis are very optimistic and dreamers. There used to be always cheery crowds at most of their public meetings.
